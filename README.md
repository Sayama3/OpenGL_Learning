# OpenGL Learning
![](https://github.com/Sayama3/OpenGL_Learning/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)
 
A little project for me to learn how to make a renderer in OpenGL.

## Requirement

To run the project, you must have OpenGL 4.3+ and C++ 20+.

## Run Build

To run a build, you can directly run one of the pre-build release _(In the GitHub action.
Soon to be released on the GitHub Releases section)_.

To correctly run the build, you must have the following architecture :

```text
resources/
├─ shaders/
│  ├─ shader.frag
│  ├─ shader.vert
OpenGL.exe
```

## Demo
Here an example of the current state of the project.
